Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing food delivery sales data to understand revenue trends, customer behavior, and regional performance. An interactive Excel dashboard was developed to help stakeholders monitor key business metrics and identify patterns across time, geography, and food preferences.

The dashboard supports data-driven decision-making by presenting insights in a clear, visual, and filterable format.

Problem Statement  
Food delivery platforms generate large volumes of transactional data on a daily basis. Without structured analysis and visualization, it becomes difficult to track sales trends, customer preferences, and high-performing regions.

The objective of this project is to:
- Analyze sales performance across different time periods  
- Compare revenue contribution by food type (Veg vs Non-Veg)  
- Identify top-performing cities and states  
- Monitor customer engagement through ratings and order behavior  

Business Requirements (BRD)

Charts and Visual Analysis  
- Monthly Sales Trend to analyze month-wise revenue changes  
- Daily Sales Trend to observe order and revenue variation across weekdays  
- Total Sales by Food Type (Veg vs Non-Veg) to compare cuisine-based revenue contribution  
- Total Sales by State using map visualization to understand geographic performance across India  
- Quarterly Performance Summary combining Sales, Ratings, and Orders  
- Top 5 Cities by Sales to identify the highest revenue-generating cities  
- Weekly Trend Analysis to track weekly sales fluctuations  

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  
- Total Sales (₹): Overall revenue generated from food orders  
- Average Customer Rating: Overall customer satisfaction level  
- Average Order Value (₹): Revenue generated per order  
- Ratings Count: Total number of customer reviews  
- Total Orders: Total number of food orders placed
